## Nocino
### Ingredients
```
1 Quart:
1         Quart sized Martinelli's Apple Juice containers
2-3       Cloves
15        Ripe Walnuts
1/2inch   Vanilla Bean
1         Cinnamon Stick
1/4       Lemon for its rinds
1.75cups  Granulated Sugar
1/2liter  Vodka
```
- It is super important that the walnuts are ripe, and the inside is not dried out. It should be very easy to cut them in halves. The walnuts are usually in season **late June**.
- I've tried two different types of Vodka: Stoli (expensive) and Vitaliy (cheap). I can't tell the difference between the two, so don't overspend on your vodka.

### Directions
1. After washing, cut the walnuts in halves.
2. Combine all ingredients in the juice container.
3. Shake container until all the sugar has dissolved.
4. Let it infuse for approximately 1 month.
5. Strain away all solid ingredients and store in a smaller container.
6. Enjoy.
7. (Optional) Store the container for as long as you want in a dark place at room temperature. The nocino will become noticeably smoother and complex.

## Shirley Temple
Homemade, using grenadine from scratch. It's a little more effort, but it tastes so better that way, trust me.
### Ingredients
```
8oz  Club Soda
1/4cup Agave Syrup
1/2cup Water
1/4lbs Pitted Dark Red Cherries
1      Lemon Peel
1/2    Juiced Lemon
1/2    Juiced Lime
1tsp   Vanilla Extract
1/4cup Ginger Ale (Optional)

```
- You can replace the Agave with any other syrup. Maple brings out an interesting taste, but sometimes can be overpowering. I would add less if you plan to use maple syrup.
- Don't skimp out on the vanilla extract. There's a *huuuuge* difference between the cheap extract and one that is $5 more.

### Directions
1. Add pitted cherries, 1/4 cup of water, 1/4 cup of syrup, 1tsp of vanilla extract to a saucepan. Cook over medium heat for 10-15min, basically until a syruppy consistency.
2. Remove pan from stove and strain.
3. Add 1 lemon peel, juiced lemon and lime, 2-3tbsp of cherry syrup, and a handful of ice into a boston shaker. Shake.
  - If you don't have a shaker, just stir the contents with ice a lot.A
4. Add 8oz of club soda, and *gently* stir. (Don't user the boston shaker here).
5. Strain shaker with glass filled with ice and enjoy!
