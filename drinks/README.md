## Nocino
### Ingredients
```
1 Quart:
1         Quart sized Martinelli's Apple Juice containers
2-3       Cloves
15        Ripe Walnuts
1/2inch   Vanilla Bean
1         Cinnamon Stick
1/4       Lemon for its rinds
1.75cups  Granulated Sugar
1/2liter  Vodka
```
- It is super important that the walnuts are ripe, and the inside is not dried out. It should be very easy to cut them in halves. The walnuts are usually in season **late June**.
- I've tried two different types of Vodka: Stoli (expensive) and Vitaliy (cheap). I can't tell the difference between the two, so don't overspend on your vodka.

### Directions
1. After washing, cut the walnuts in halves.
2. Combine all ingredients in the juice container.
3. Shake container until all the sugar has dissolved.
4. Let it infuse for approximately 1 month.
5. Strain away all solid ingredients and store in a smaller container.
6. Enjoy.
7. (Optional) Store the container for as long as you want in a dark place at room temperature. The nocino will become noticeably smoother and complex.7.
