## Homemade Lox
### Ingredients
```
14-16z Salmon (Preferably Lock Duart)
3tbsp  Chopped terragon
3tbsp  Chopped dill
3tbsp  Chopped fennel fronds
1/2cup Salt
1/2    Sugar
       Saran Wrap
```

- The actual amount of terragon/dill/fennel doesn't need to be 3tbsp. Just enough to baste and cover your salmon.
- Cutting away the salmon skin is optional.

### Instructions
1. Combine terragon, dill, and fennel in a bowl to make a nice herb mixture.
2. Combine salt and sugar in another bowl.
3. Wash your salmon, then coat the salmon with the aromatics. Take some time to rub those herbs in with your hand, for all sides.
4. Coat the salmon thoroughly with the salt+sugar mixture
5. Wrap the salmon, herbs, salt, sugar in plastic wrap. Place in a tray, and let it sit overnight for at least 12-24 hours.
  * The longer it sits, the saltier it gets.
  * I tend to like mine less salty, so I stop at the 12 hour mark. 
6. Once it's cured, remove the excell salt and sugar, and now you're done!
