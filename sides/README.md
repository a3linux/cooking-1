## Homemade Lox
### Ingredients
```
14-16z Salmon (Preferably Lock Duart)
3tbsp  Chopped terragon
3tbsp  Chopped dill
3tbsp  Chopped fennel fronds
1/2cup Salt
1/2    Sugar
       Saran Wrap
```

- The actual amount of terragon/dill/fennel doesn't need to be 3tbsp. Just enough to baste and cover your salmon.
- Cutting away the salmon skin is optional. You can make salmon skin bacon with it if you cure it!
  - Pan fry the skin (after scaling) with brown sugar, bourbon, and some neutral oil, and that's it!

### Instructions
1. Combine terragon, dill, and fennel in a bowl to make a nice herb mixture.
2. Combine salt and sugar in another bowl.
3. Wash your salmon, then coat the salmon with the aromatics. Take some time to rub those herbs in with your hand, for all sides.
4. Coat the salmon thoroughly with the salt+sugar mixture
5. Wrap the salmon, herbs, salt, sugar in plastic wrap. Place in a tray, and let it sit overnight for at least 12-24 hours.
  * The longer it sits, the saltier it gets.
  * I tend to like mine less salty, so I stop at the 12 hour mark. 
6. Once it's cured, remove the excess salt and sugar, and now you're done!

## Asazuke
### Ingredients
```
2       Persian or Japanese Cucumbers
1tsp    Salt
2pieces Cut Kombu
```

### Instructions
1. Wipe away the dust and coat the kombu with a thin layer of water
2. Cut the cucumbers into small pieces
3. Combine all ingredients in a plastic bag or a pickling bin
4. Mix and wait 60-90min. The more you leave it sitting in the water, the saltier it gets.
5. When the correct salinity is reached, remove salty water and replace with tap water before storing.

## Dashimaki Tamago
This is the best recipe I've come across for tamagoyaki. Simple, not too sweet, but packed with flavor.

### Ingredients
```
4      Eggs
1/4cup Dashi
1tsp   Soy Sauce (preferrably light)
1/4tsp Salt
1tsp   Sugar
1tsp   Mirin
       Oil
```

### Instructions
1. Mix all ingredients in a bowl
2. Heat pan in medium heat with a little oil. Until surface gets to about ~180ºF
3. Pour a third of the mixture on the pan, creating a thin layer of egg. Dont let it cook too much. Start folding it over.
4. When no more egg is left to fold, add another third to create another layer of egg to fold over.
5. Repeat one more time until no egg mixture is left.
6. Set aside to cool for about 3minutes before cutting.

## Fried Eggplants
Eggplants prepared Italian style.
### Ingredients
```
1-2 Eggplants, American (with thick black skin).
    Salt
    Grapeseed Oil for frying
```
- According to Eleonara Consoli, a rockstar Sicillian mama with her own books and cooking show, the black-skinned eggplants are the way to go here instead of the thin skinned asian eggplants which are more suited for Sichuan cooking.

### Directions
1. Cut eggplant length-wise, and leave the skin on.
2. Sprinkle with salt to draw moisture out. Don't worry about adding too much salt. 30-60min.
3. Wash and strain with a towl for each slice.
4. Heat oil to 330ºF and fry until both sides are golden brown. Pat with paper towles to remove excess oil.
