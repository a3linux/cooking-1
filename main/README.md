## French Onion Soup
### Ingredients
```
Serves: 2 people
3tbsp   Unsalted Butter
1.5lbs  Onions of mixed color.
1/2     Bay Leaf
1/4cup  Dry Sherry
1qt     Chicken or Beef Stock
1sprig  Fresh Thyme
        Rustic Bread (Stale is better)
1       Baguette that is wide and flat enough to fit your container
1clove  Garlic
1/2lb   Gruyere Cheese to grate
```

- The types of onions you use are very important in how this soup turns out. [Serious Eats](http://www.byrontalbott.com/?s=french+onion+soup) points out the following:
> **Sweet Onion:** mellow and sweet, with a brightness right at the end.
> **Red Onion:** deeper flaver with a slightly bitter edge and less sweetness.
> **Yellow Onion:** lots of bright flavor, very mild bitterness, and sweetness backing it up.
> **Shallot:** really good balance of sweetness with both bright flavors and deep, rich ones, and just a hint of bitterness.

- I've found that the bitterness that comes from the red onions is very similar to the bitterness that comes from any overcooked onion. Red onions turn grey instead of golden brown when carmelized, which makes it difficult to time your cooking.
- So far my best ratio is **1:1:5 for Yellow:White:Shallots**.
- I've found that using homemade beef stock gives a more impactful flavor than using homemade chicken stock. If using homemade chicken stock, you might have to add extra salt to counter the sweetness of the onions.

### Instructions
1. Thinly slice the onions. (Rainbow slices).
2. Get a pot that would fit all of your onions. Add your butter and onions and start cooking with medium heat.
  * It will look like you have too much sliced onions. Don't worry, it will reduce over time.
3. Cook onions until soft. Then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer semi-frequently for the next 2 hours.
  * If the onions start burning at the bottom of the pot, add a little bit of water. (You will have to do this multiple times)
4. Add sherry. Cook until you don't smell alcohol, then add stock, the bay leaf, thyme. Raise heat to bring to simmer. Then lower heat to maintain simmer for 20min.
5. Get your bread ready. If you're using non stale bread, get the oven on, and bake both breads (rustic and baguette) until lightly toasted. Break them into small pieces and leave them into the serving bowls you will use.
6. Get the baguette and cut it so that it fits perfectly with the opening of your container.
7. Rub the garlic onto the newly cut large piece of bread, and if you want add some butter.
8. Preheat broiler.
9. Add the soup to the serving bowls that have pieces of rustic bread in them. Then place the perfect fitting baguette bread on top.
10. Grate the guyere cheese over the bowl+baguette. Liberally.
11. Broil until cheese is melted and browned in spots.
12. Let it cool 5-10min before serving.
