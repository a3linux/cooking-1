## French Onion Soup
### Ingredients
```
Serves: 2-3 people
3tbsp   Unsalted Butter
1.5lbs  Onions of mixed color.
1/2     Bay Leaf
1/4cup  Dry Sherry
1qt     Chicken or Beef Stock
1sprig  Fresh Thyme
        Rustic Bread (Stale is better)
1       Baguette that is wide and flat enough to fit your container
1clove  Garlic
1/2lb   Gruyere Cheese to grate
```

- The types of onions you use are very important in how this soup turns out. [Serious Eats](http://www.byrontalbott.com/?s=french+onion+soup) points out the following:
> **Sweet Onion:** mellow and sweet, with a brightness right at the end.
> **Red Onion:** deeper flaver with a slightly bitter edge and less sweetness.
> **Yellow Onion:** lots of bright flavor, very mild bitterness, and sweetness backing it up.
> **Shallot:** really good balance of sweetness with both bright flavors and deep, rich ones, and just a hint of bitterness.

- I've found that the bitterness that comes from the red onions is very similar to the bitterness that comes from any overcooked onion. Red onions turn grey instead of golden brown when carmelized, which makes it difficult to time your cooking.
- So far my best ratio is **1:1:5 for Yellow:White:Shallots**.
- I've found that using homemade beef stock gives a more impactful flavor than using homemade chicken stock. If using homemade chicken stock, you might have to add extra salt to counter the sweetness of the onions.

### Instructions
1. Thinly slice the onions. (Rainbow slices).
2. Get a pot that would fit all of your onions. Add your butter and onions and start cooking with medium heat.
  * It will look like you have too much sliced onions. Don't worry, it will reduce over time.
3. Cook onions until soft. Then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer semi-frequently for the next 2 hours.
  * If the onions start burning at the bottom of the pot, add a little bit of water. (You will have to do this multiple times)
4. Add sherry. Cook until you don't smell alcohol, then add stock, the bay leaf, thyme. Raise heat to bring to simmer. Then lower heat to maintain simmer for 20min.
5. Get your bread ready. If you're using non stale bread, get the oven on, and bake both breads (rustic and baguette) until lightly toasted. Break them into small pieces and leave them into the serving bowls you will use.
6. Get the baguette and cut it so that it fits perfectly with the opening of your container.
7. Rub the garlic onto the newly cut large piece of bread, and if you want add some butter.
8. Preheat broiler.
9. Add the soup to the serving bowls that have pieces of rustic bread in them. Then place the perfect fitting baguette bread on top.
10. Grate the guyere cheese over the bowl+baguette. Liberally.
11. Broil until cheese is melted and browned in spots.
12. Let it cool 5-10min before serving.

## Sweet & Sour Grilled Sea Bass
Asian/Hawaiian inspired dish that's great for the Spring and Summer. The glaze recipe is teriyaki-like and I'm very proud of it.

### Ingredients
```
10oz   White fish(Sea bass, Halibut, Snapper), Salmon, or Tuna
3tbsp  Olive oil
pinch  Salt
1tsp   Cayenne pepper
1tsp   Paprika
1tsp   Lemon Zest
1tsp   Grated Garlic
pinch  Chopped parsley (Italian)

Glaze:
3tbsp  Mirin
2tbsp  Sherry vinegar
2tbsp  Rice wine vinegar
2tbsp  Soy sauce
2tsp   Grated ginger
1tbsp  Brown sugar
```

- Original recipe calls for skewering this over the grill, but since I don't have a grill or skewers, I use a pan and fry it without skewers. Eaten with rice.
- I've tried both paprika and smoked paprika. Depending on the type of smoked paprika, I feel like the smoked paprika combined with the wine and vinegars make it a little too bold.
- If you use skewers, make sure you soak the skewers in water for 30min before using to prevent charring.

### Instructions
1. Slice fish into thick strips or cubes.
2. Add the chunks into the mixing bowl, 3tbsp olive oil, pinch of salt, 1tsp cayenne pepper, 1tsp paprika, 1tsp lemon zest, chopped parsely, 1tsp grated garlic.
3. Set the fish aside, and heat a small sauce pan to medium heat. Add all sauce ingredients, and let it reduce for 10min. Then remove from heat.
4. Grill the fish (or fry on a suace pan) for about 2-3min each side.
5. Remove fish from the heat and serve with the glaze.

## Gordon Ramsay's Slow Roasted Pork Belly
**Currently Work In Progress**

Gordon Ramsay posts an amazing cooking video, be never posts the recipe! This is my attempt to recreate the amaze-balls pork belly he cooks.
### Ingredients
```
Serving Size: 4-5
2lbs    Pork belly with the skin attached.
Pinch   Salt
1       Medium-sized bulb of fennel including some fronds.
3cloves Garlic
Handful Fennel Seeds
Pinch   Cardimom Seeds
2cupts  White Wine
2tbsp   Seeded Mustard
1slice  Bread
```
### Instructions
1. Wash the slab of pork belly. Using a sharp knife, make diagonal streaks on the skin 1/2 inch deep -- just enough to embed grains of salt. Rotate 180 and make more diagonal streaks on the skin, creating a diamond-hatch pattern.
2. Rub salt all over the skin. When applying, roll the slab so that the streaks open up, letting the salt trap in between.
3. Preheat oven to *355ºF*.
4. Cut fennel into course pieces. Big enough to eat with a fork, but small enough to be included in a chunky sauce.
5. Add generous amounts of olive oil in the sauce pan. Add chopped fennel, crushed garlic, cardimom seeds, star anise, and a handful of fennel seeds to a sauce pan over medium-high heat.
6. Sear the pork belly skin side on the sauce pan for 1-2 minutes. The skin should be golden-brown and crispy after this.
7. Flip the pork belly and add more fennel seeds in between the diamond etches.
8. Add white wine and let it reduce until the alcohol burns off.
9. Add stock to the sauce pan until it almost fully immerses the pork belly, leaving the skin exposed.
10. Leave in oven and bake for 2-2.5 hours. This depends on how much stock you ultimately end up using. Leave in the oven until the liquid level is almost completely reduced.
11. Place the pork belly on the serving dish. Use a piece of bread to remove all the extra oil left in the sauce pan.
12. Add a dallop of mustard, stir, and use that as a sauce.

### Notes
- So far a good presentation dish, but flavor massively needs work.
- The Fennel and cardimom combination doesn't work as well.

## Fish Fragrant Eggplant
This is essentially my favorite Chinese dish. A common peasant meal in the Sicchuan province, it uses basic ingredients to create a luxuriant dish with warm colors and rich complex flavors.

The key to do this dish correctly is to prepare the eggplants in a way that the bitterness is taken away while the moisture is maintained. As always, the food lab goes in to super detail about this:
> Whatever eggplan you use, one thing's for sure: Simply cutting them and stir-frying them does *not* work. The eggplants absorb all the oil, leaving dry sponts on the wok, which in turn allows the eggplant to stick and burn. Raw, untreated eggplants also take a long time to cook through, axacerbating the burning problem. Why is that?
>
> It's because eggplants contain so much excess air, distributed withing a spongy cell network. Air acts as an insuator, whihc means that heat travels through and eggplant very slowly.

### Ingredients
```
1/2cup Kosher salt
1.5qts Water
1.5lbs Japanese/Chinese Eggplants - Trimmed, split into quarters 3-4inches long

Pickled Chili Sauce Preparation:
2       Red Thai bird chillies
2tbsp   White Vinegar
2tbsp   Shaoxing Wine
1tbsp   Sugar
2tsp    Soy Sauce (Dark)
1tbsp   Chinkiang Black Vinegar
1.25tsp Corn Starch

Recipe:
~3tbsp Cooking Oil with a high smoke point (e.g. Peanut Oil)
4tsp   Minced Ginger
4      Medium cloves of garlic crushed
4      Green Onions, chopped
1.5    Sichuan Chili Broad Bean Paste
4oz    Chicken Stock
2tbsp  Sesame Oil
       Roughly chopped cilantro as garnish.
```

### Instructions
1. Combine salt and water to make a brine. Cut eggplants into pieces and let it soak for 15-20min. Ideally, keep the eggplants skin-side up so the fleshy part is in contact with the salt water.
2. Heat white vinegar until it starts to bubble. Pour in a small sauce jar over chopped fresh thai bird chilis. Wait 5min.
3. Add the rest of the pickled chili sauce ingredients and stir and set aside.
4. Take the eggplants out of the water and individually dry them out. 
	- This is very important because the presence of moisture during wok fry makes it exponentially difficult to create a char, resulting in a mushy eggplant. Water has a very high specific heat.
5. Heat oil in wok, right up until smoke point. (At the very least above water boil temp - 212ºF). Then reduce heat to Medium.
6. Add eggplants in batches. Don't overcrowd the wok. Heat each side of the eggplant until Maillard reaction occurs then flip. Remove when all sides are charred.
7. Add oil to wok again if not much left. Add broad bean paste to wok and stir around until oil is red.
8. Add garlic, green onions, and ginger and let it cook until fragrant.
9. Add eggplant, stock, and the pickled chili sauce. Stir fry everything.
10. Cut the heat, move to serving dish. Top it off with sesame oil and chopped cilantro as garnish.

Cheddar, Jack, or Colby cheese, grated
Sour Cream
Jalapeno or poblano peppers, diced and seeded
Onion, diced

```

No need to go all out on purchasing the beef short-rib. Too much marbeling can cause the chili to get oily.

### Instructions
1. Beans + 6tbsp salt + water in large plastic container. Soak for 8 hours. Drain and rinse soaked beans.
2. Add dried chiles to large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stock pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until slightly darkened with intense, roasted aroma, 2 to 5 minutes. Do let it smoke! Remove chiles to small bowl and set aside. Alternatively, place dried chilies on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power in 15-second increments until pliable and toasted-smelling, about 30 seconds total.
3. Season short ribs on all sides with salt + pepper. Add oil to Dutch oven and heat over high heat until smoking. Add half of short ribs and brown well on all sides (it may be necessary to brown ribs in three batches, depending on size of Dutch oven—do not overcrowd pan), 8 to 12 minutes total, reducing heat if fat begins to smoke excessively or meat begins to burn. Transfer to large rimmed baking sheet or plate. Repeat with remaining short ribs, browning them in fat remaining in Dutch oven. Once all short ribs are cooked, transfer all rendered fat into small bowl and reserve separately. Allow short ribs to cool at room temperature.
4. Return Dutch Oven to medium-high heat and add 1cup chicken broth, using flat wooden spoon or stiff spatula to scrape browned bits off of bottom of pan. Reduce heat until chicken broth is at a bare simmer, add toasted chiles to liquid and cook until chiles have softened and liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer chiles and liquid to blender, add anchovy, marmite, soy sauce, tomato paste, ground spices, coffee, and chocolate, and blend at high speed, scraping down sides as necessary, until completely smooth puree is formed, about 2 minutes. Set chile puree aside.
5. Trim meat from short ribs bones and hand-chop into rough, 1/2-inch to 1/4-inch pieces (finer or larger, if you prefer), reserving bones separately. Add any accumulated meat juices to chili puree.
6. Heat 4 tablespoons rendered beef fat (if necessary, add vegetable oil to reach 4 tablespoons) in large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed stock pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add fresh chiles, garlic, and oregano and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chile puree and cook, stirring frequently and scraping bottom of pot until chile mixture begins to fry and leaves a coating on bottom of pan, 2 to 4 minutes. Add chicken stock, chopped beef, beef bones, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, scraping bottom of pan to loosen browned bits. Reduce heat to lowest possible setting, add beans, and cook, with cover slightly ajar, until beans are almost tender, about 1 hour. Add crushed tomatoes and cider vinegar and cook with cover slightly ajar until beans and beef are fully tender and broth is rich and lightly thickened, 2 to 3 1/2 hours longer, adding water if necessary to keep beans and meat mostly submerged (a little protrusion is ok).
7. Using tongs, remove and discard bay leaves and bones (at this point, any excess meat still attached to the bones can be removed, chopped, and added back to the chili, if desired). Add vodka (or bourbon), hot sauce, and brown sugar, and stir to combine. Season to taste with kosher salt, ground black pepper, and additional vinegar
8. Serve immediately, or for best flavor, allow to cool and refrigerate overnight, or up to 1 week in sealed container. Reheat, and serve with desired garnishes.

## Mohito Chicken
This is a good dish to make if you have lots of limes left over.

### Ingredients
```
1-2lb  Chicken

Marinade:
2      Shallots
1/4cup Mint, coarsely chopped
1/4cup Rum
1tbsp  Lime zest, grated
1/2    Lime juice. (about 8 limes)
3tbsp  Honey
2tbsp  Canola Oil
1tbsp  Kosher Salt
```
- Chicken thighs are much more preferrable over chicken breast. They are easier to cook well and they taste better. The thigh meat compliments the mohito marinade very well, imho.

### Directions
1. If meat is frozen, thaw it out.
2. Add all ingredients except for the meat in a food processer. Pulse until shallots are finely chopped. (Alternatively, you can cut everything up very finely yourself with a knife).
3. Add marinade to bowl with 1-2lb of meat. Let it sit for 1-24hours.
4. Preheat oven to 400ºF and pan fry marinated chicken on a hot pan. Put the chicken on the pan when surface of pan is around ~200ºF. Pan fry the chicken until char marks appear on all sides.
5. Stick it in the oven until internal temperatur of chicken reaches 160-165ºF. This is approximately 15min
