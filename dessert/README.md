- Food Processor would be helpful here to pulverize the nuts for the topping.
- Use (dark|milk) chocolate to create different flavors.

### Instructions
1. Mix condensed milk and water to set aside.
2. Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt until well mixed.
3. Add butter and mix until texture resembles cornmeal. (5 minutes with mixer, more by hand)
4. Mix in condensed milk and water and continue mixing until fully incorporated. Dough should form in a ball.
5. Squish the ball and make a 1inch think pizza. Saran wrap and refrigerate for 20minutes.
6. Cut pizza into 8 slices. Take one and leave the rest in the refrigerator.
7. The pizza slice can be made into 2-5 pocky sticks.
8. Repeat until no more dough is left. Preheat oven to 300ÂºF. Refrigerate for 10minutes
9. Bake until golden brown (~14minutes. Rotate pan at 7min) and let cool. 
10. Melt chocolate with a double bath. (Boiling water in one pot, and another pot over it with the chips to be melted)
11. Add Vegetable oil to your liking. Adding more makes it easier to coat, but not as thick layer of chocolate on pocky.
12. Dip sticks in melted chocolate and have fun!
